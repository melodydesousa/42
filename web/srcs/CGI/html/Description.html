<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<li><strong> <br>Ici, nous expliquons webserv : The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application protocol for distributed,
    <br>collaborative, hypermedia information systems.
    <br>HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web, where hypertext documents include hyperlinks to other resources that the user can easily access.
    <br>For example, by a mouse click or by tapping the screen in a web browser.
    <br>HTTP was developed to facilitate hypertext and the World Wide Web.
    <br>The primary function of a web server is to store, process, and deliver web pages to
    <br>clients. The communication between client and server takes place using the Hypertext
    <br>Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
    <br>Pages delivered are most frequently HTML documents, which may include images,
    <br>style sheets, and scripts in addition to the text content.
    <br>Multiple web servers may be used for a high-traffic website.
    <br>A user agent, commonly a web browser or web crawler, initiates communication by
    <br>requesting a specific resource using HTTP and the server responds with the content of
    <br>that resource or an error message if unable to do so. The resource is typically a real file
    <br>on the serverâ€™s secondary storage, but this is not necessarily the case and depends on how
    <br>the webserver is implemented.
    <br>While the primary function is to serve content, full implementation of HTTP also
    <br>includes ways of receiving content from c</strong> </li>
